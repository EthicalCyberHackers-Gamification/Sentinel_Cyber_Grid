## Product

Ethical CyberHackers Platform — a frontend-only browser cybersecurity training app
(`artifacts/ethical-cyberhackers-platform/`, preview path `/`) with two missions
(M1 = mission-001, M2 = mission-002).

### Mission Briefing Room (Milestone 24I)
A reusable layer between mission selection and investigation. Each mission shows 3
interactive briefing cards (Review Briefing → ✓ Reviewed), a Mission Readiness score
(0/3 → "Ready For Investigation"), a launch gate, per-card manager reactions, a "Begin
Investigation" launch sequence, +10 XP once per mission, and scorecard rows.
- Data-driven via `MISSION_BRIEFINGS` in `script.js` (~564). Shared helpers:
  `renderBriefingRoom`, `reviewBriefingCard`, `updateBriefingGate`, `showBriefingWarning`,
  `runBriefingLaunch`, `beginInvestigation`, `buildBriefingSummaryHTML`,
  `briefingReadinessPct` / `isBriefingComplete`.
- Launch buttons (`#beginMissionBtn` M1, `#m2BeginBtn` M2) stay clickable but carry
  `.begin-locked`; an early click fires the warning "Review all briefing materials before
  starting the assignment." instead of being disabled. M1 "continue" mode
  (`data-mode="continue"`) bypasses gating.
- Both briefing rooms render UNCONDITIONALLY at boot (`renderBriefingRoom` x2 before
  `restoreSavedProgress`), so the hosts are never empty on a clean session — restore
  returns early when nothing is saved. They also re-render on restore, on
  `showMission2Overview`, and on the M1 enter-module loader callback.
- State `briefingReviewed` (per-mission Sets) + one-time `briefingXpAwarded` are
  persisted; restore only accepts card IDs present in `MISSION_BRIEFINGS` (corrupt-state
  hardening) and readiness is clamped 0–100. Cleared in `resetMission` / `resetMission2`.
- NOTE: `script.js` is loaded as an ES module (`<script type="module">`), so its functions
  are NOT global — console-based test navigation won't work; drive M2 via the real
  "Continue to Mission 2" CTA (or prime `ech.progress.v1` with `mission1Complete:true`).

### Evidence Prioritization + Investigation Board
Students do not auto-receive evidence. They must manually PIN reviewed findings to an
Investigation Board and CLASSIFY each one's suspicion level (Normal Activity / Low
Suspicion / Helpful Supporting Evidence / Critical Threat Evidence).
- Core module lives near the top of `script.js` (after `renderConfidenceMeter`):
  `EVIDENCE_RATINGS`, `SUSPICION_LEVELS`, `investigationPins`, `pinnableFindings`,
  `pinXpAwarded`, plus `showPinPrompt` / `showClassificationPrompt` /
  `handlePinClassification` / `renderInvestigationBoard` / `buildInvestigationQualityHTML`.
- M1 Evidence Confidence is derived PURELY from pins (`recomputeConfidenceFromPins`);
  the finding submission no longer adds confidence on top.
- M1 gate: pinning `suspicious_file.txt` as Critical unlocks the decision/finding flow.
  Re-reading the suspicious file after a reload re-opens the gate via `canCompleteM1()`
  (resume-safe — no soft-lock).
- M2 keeps its command-based confidence and adds the pin contribution one-time on top.
- Pins, pinnable findings, and one-time XP guards are persisted (save/restore) and cleared
  on `resetMission` / `resetMission2`. Terminal directory context is NOT persisted (resets
  to `~` on resume by design).

### Mission Focus Mode + Expandable Panels (Milestone 25A)
A UX/immersion layer (no flow/logic changes) that declutters the mission dashboards.
The 25A module lives near the bottom of `script.js` (~6240+).
- **Manager chat feed**: `#managerText` / `#m2ManagerText` are `.manager-feed` containers
  of `.manager-bubble`. `pushManagerMessage(missionId, text)` appends a bubble (dedupes the
  consecutive repeat, trims to last 5, slide-in + panel flash). ALL manager writes route
  through it.
- **Focus Mode**: `body.focus-mode` hides `.xp-panel` + `#taskBrief` and collapses
  `.focus-collapse` cards; `body.mission-running` shows the floating `#focusControlBar`
  (toggle `#focusToggleBtn`). Helpers: `enterFocusMode` / `exitFocusMode` /
  `toggleFocusMode` / `setMissionRunning` / `updateFocusBar`. `setMissionRunning(true)` +
  `enterFocusMode()` fire on `beginMission` / `beginMission2`; `setMissionRunning(false)`
  on `resetMission` / `resetMission2` / `backToModuleOverview` / `backToMission2Overview` /
  `hideMission2Overview` / `showMission2Overview`.
  - RESUME-SAFE (25A architect fix): re-entering an in-progress mission re-asserts the bar.
    `beginMission2()` calls `setMissionRunning(true)`+`enterFocusMode()` BEFORE its
    `m2Started` early-return; `enterModule()` re-asserts them when
    `missionStarted && !missionComplete` (since `beginMission()`'s early guard would skip).
- **Collapsible cards**: generic `.collapsible` / `.is-collapsed` with `.collapsible-head`
  + `.collapsible-body`, a delegated click+keydown handler (`initCollapsibleCards`, wired in
  `boot()`), and a CSS `::after` chevron. Applied to briefing sections, briefing rooms,
  mission progress/status, progress tracker, and tools panels (M1+M2). Begin/launch CTAs are
  OUTSIDE `.focus-collapse` so collapsing never hides them.
- **Current Objective card** (`#currentObjective` / `#m2CurrentObjective`) mirrors the hint
  via `setCurrentObjective`, called from `setHint` / `setM2Hint`.
- **Command grouping**: M1 `renderButtons` groups buttons via `ensureGroup()` +
  `m1CommandCategory()` ("Inspect Files" for `cat-*`, else "Navigate"); M2 static buttons
  are wrapped in labeled `.cmd-group` divs (data-m2cmd selectors + `syncM2Buttons` unchanged).
- **Sound-free animations**: `fxFlash` / `fxToast` / `fxPulse*` helpers hooked into
  `awardXP` (toast + badge flash), `handlePinClassification` (board/confidence pulse +
  "Evidence Added" toast), `increaseTrustScore`, `setThreatLevel`, `unlockTool` (glow +
  toast), `updateManagerReaction` (mission_completed → "Mission Complete!" toast).

### Guided Spotlight Mission Flow (Milestone 25B)
A guided onboarding layer on top of the briefing room (no flow/logic changes). The 25B
module lives at the bottom of `script.js` (~6485+).
- **Guided briefing overlay** (`#guidedOverlay` / `.guided-overlay`): `startGuidedBriefing(missionId, startFn)`
  replaces the direct begin call on both Begin buttons (`#beginMissionBtn` M1, `#m2BeginBtn` M2).
  It dims the page and presents ONE briefing card at a time (3 per mission) with a Sarah
  Reyes lead-in (`GUIDED_BRIEFING_INTROS`), a "Briefing Step X of N" counter, and a
  "Got it — Next"/"Got it — Finish" button (`#guidedNextBtn`). `advanceGuidedStep` reuses
  `reviewBriefingCard` (marks reviewed + one-time XP + persist — never duplicates logic).
  Then a "Mission Ready" screen → "Launch Investigation" (`#guidedLaunchBtn`) → terminal
  launch lines ("Initializing analyst workstation...") via `runGuidedLaunch` → `finishGuidedLaunch`
  enables the spotlight (`igEnabled = true`) and calls the original `beginMission`/`beginMission2`.
- **Investigation spotlight tour** (non-blocking, dismissible): `IG_PHASES` walks
  commands → files (M1) → board → decision. `igShow` renders a light dim (`#igDim`,
  `pointer-events:none` so it NEVER blocks clicks), a glow ring on the target
  (`.ig-spotlight-target`), and a coach tip (`#igCoach`) with a "Got it" dismiss. Hooks:
  `ensureGroup` sets `group.dataset.cmdGroup`; `renderButtons` fires the files phase;
  `showPinPrompt` fires board; `showDecisionActions` fires decision. `igShow` defers via
  `igModalOpen` retry (bounded, max 40 / ~20s) while the alert modal or overlay is up.
- **Resume safety / teardown**: `startGuidedBriefing` skips the overlay if
  `missionStarted`/`m2Started` is already true. `igEnabled` is set ONLY at
  `finishGuidedLaunch` (never during restore). `endGuidedRun()` fully tears down DOM +
  state (cancels pending launch timers via `clearGuidedLaunchTimers`, unbinds the tracked
  spotlight target listener, clears `igPhasesShown`/`igPending`, nulls `guidedState`); it
  is called from `resetMission`, `resetMission2`, `backToModuleOverview`,
  `hideMission2Overview`, `backToMission2Overview`, and the `enterModule` resume path.
  `finishGuidedLaunch` is gated on a live `guidedState` so a stale launch timer can never
  resurrect a torn-down run.
- **Auto-open on mission load (25B fix)**: the overlay now opens AUTOMATICALLY when a
  fresh mission dashboard/overview loads — not just on a Begin click — so the student
  starts in the centered guided flow instead of the left sidebar. `enterModule`'s loader
  callback calls `startGuidedBriefing("mission-001", beginMission)` when
  `!missionStarted && !missionComplete`; `showMission2Overview` calls
  `startGuidedBriefing("mission-002", beginMission2)` when `!m2Started && !mission2Complete`.
  Each overlay step card shows a "Mission Briefing Room" heading (`.guided-room-title`).
  Launch lines are exactly "Initializing analyst workstation..." / "Loading file
  investigation tools..." / "Mission ready."; on launch the M1 Current Objective is set to
  "Open the documents folder and inspect the files." Console logs:
  `"Guided briefing overlay opened"` (on open) and
  `"Guided briefing complete. Investigation launched."` (on Launch click).
- **Resume-safe mid-mission reload (25B fix)**: `missionStarted`/`m2Started` are
  session-only (NOT persisted), so they can't gate "already started" across a reload. The
  fix adds a DURABLE per-mission flag `missionLaunched` (`{"mission-001","mission-002"}`),
  set true + `saveProgress()` at the end of `beginMission`/`beginMission2`, persisted in
  `saveProgress`, restored in `restoreSavedProgress`, and cleared in
  `resetMission`/`resetMission2`. `hasMissionProgress(missionId)` returns true when
  `missionLaunched[missionId]` is set OR any persisted investigation activity exists
  (completion flags, `evidenceLog`, `investigationPins`, `decisionTaken`, `m1FilesReviewed`,
  `m1Confidence`/`m2Confidence`) — the launched flag specifically covers a reload right
  after launch with zero activity yet. `startGuidedBriefing` skips the overlay and calls
  `startFn` directly (`beginMission`/`beginMission2`) when
  `alreadyStarted || hasMissionProgress(...)`. Since `missionStarted`/`m2Started` are false
  after reload, those begin functions run fully and RE-RENDER the live investigation view
  (hide briefing, show command buttons, re-enter Focus Mode) instead of soft-locking — so a
  mid-mission reload resumes straight into the investigation with NO re-onboarding overlay.
  XP/pins remain XP-once guarded. (Note: `m2UnlockedCmds`/`furthestSeqIndex` are still not
  persisted — a pre-existing limitation; resume restores the base command set plus persisted
  evidence/board, sufficient to continue.)

### Cyber Missions Map (Milestone 25C)
A 2D dark/cyber mission-SELECTION screen shown AFTER name entry + the simulation loader,
BEFORE the investigation. Pure selection layer — it reuses the existing progress state
(`missionComplete` / `mission2Complete`) and does NOT add a second progress system. The
25C module lives in `script.js` after `enterModule` (~4275+), with boot() wiring (~6421).
- **Flow**: `#moduleLanding` → Enter Module → `runSimulationLoader` → `showMissionsMap()`
  (NEW — `enterModule`'s loader callback now calls this instead of revealing M1 directly).
  Click a node → details panel + transmission update → "Launch Mission" → existing flow:
  M1 → `openMission1Dashboard()` (the OLD `enterModule` reveal body, extracted), M2 →
  `showMission2Overview()`, M3 → locked (no launch).
- **Node states** (`renderMissionMapStates` from `missionMapStatus`): M1 available|completed;
  M2 locked until M1 complete, then available|completed; M3 always locked/"Coming Soon".
  Path lines (`#mapPath12`/`#mapPath23`) light (`.map-path-line--lit`) when their target
  is reachable. Locked nodes stay CLICKABLE (to view their locked details) — only the
  Launch button is disabled. Data is `MISSION_MAP` in `script.js` (titles/role/threat/
  briefing/skills/transmission per mission).
- **Details + transmission**: `renderMissionDetails` rebuilds `#missionDetailsPanel` via
  innerHTML (Launch listener re-added each render — safe, old node is discarded);
  `renderMapTransmission` sets `#mapTransmissionText` (Sarah Reyes per-mission message,
  animated "TRANSMISSION ACTIVE" dot).
- **Back to Missions Map** buttons: `#m1MapBackBtn` (M1 dashboard header), `#m2MapBackBtn`
  (M2 dashboard header), `#m2OverviewMapBackBtn` (M2 overview) — all call `showMissionsMap()`
  with NO progress loss.
- **Single-active-screen invariant**: `showMissionsMap()` and `openMission1Dashboard()` hide
  all sibling screens before showing theirs; `showMission2Overview()` was updated (25C) to
  ALSO hide `#missionsMap` so launching M2 from the map never stacks screens.
- **Resume-safe**: `showMissionsMap()` calls `setMissionRunning(false)` + `endGuidedRun()`;
  `openMission1Dashboard()` defers to `startGuidedBriefing()` (which resumes via
  `hasMissionProgress`/`missionLaunched` rather than re-onboarding). Map markup is rendered
  statically in `index.html` (`#missionsMap`, hidden by default); states recompute on every
  `showMissionsMap()`. Responsive: side-by-side desktop, stacked on ≤900px (SVG paths hidden).

### Split-Screen Mission Control Layout (Milestone 25D)
A UX/immersion layer (no flow/logic changes, no new progress system) that reflows each
mission dashboard into a 70%/30% split DURING an active mission. Reuses the existing
`.dashboard` grid markup (M1 `#dashboard`, M2 `#mission2Dashboard`) and the same
`missionMapStatus` progress flags as the full map.
- **70/30 split gated on `body.mission-running`** (CSS block appended at END of `style.css`):
  `body.mission-running .dashboard{grid-template-columns:7fr 3fr}` with `.center-column`
  `order:1` (LEFT = terminal + commands), `.mission-panel` `order:2` (RIGHT = mission
  control), and `.xp-panel{display:none}` (the agent profile is folded away during play).
  Declutter: `body.mission-running .commands-panel .hint-panel{display:none}` (the relocated
  Current Objective supersedes the inline hint pill). Responsive `@media(max-width:900px)`
  stacks to one column with the terminal first (`.center-column{order:-1}`); placed AFTER the
  desktop rules so source order wins ties.
- **Compact "Mission Route" map** lives at the TOP of each `.mission-panel` `.panel-body`
  (`.mini-map-panel` with label "Mission Route" + an "Open Full Map" button —
  `#m1OpenFullMapBtn` / `#m2OpenFullMapBtn` — wired to `showMissionsMap()` in `boot()`). The
  map host `#m1MiniMap` / `#m2MiniMap` holds 3 `.mini-node[data-mission]` + 2
  `.mini-path[data-path="12"/"23"]`. `renderMiniMap(rootId, activeMissionId)` (after
  `renderMissionMapStates`, ~4410) toggles `.mini-node--available|completed|locked|active`
  (active = the panel's own mission) and `.mini-path--lit` from `missionMapStatus`;
  `renderAllMiniMaps()` refreshes both. Hooked into `showMissionsMap`, `openMission1Dashboard`,
  `showMission2Overview`, `completeMission`, the M2 quiz completion + `completeMissionEngine`,
  `resetMission`, `resetMission2`, and `boot()` (resetMissionEngine delegates to the resets).
- **Current Objective relocated** into the right control panel (`#currentObjective` M1,
  `#m2CurrentObjective` M2, both gain `.current-objective--control`); the originals were
  removed from the commands panels. IDs preserved so `setCurrentObjective` is unchanged.
- "Open Full Map" returns to the full `#missionsMap` via `showMissionsMap()` with NO progress
  loss (same handler as the existing "Back to Missions Map" buttons).

### Three-Column Active Investigation Layout (Milestone 25E)
A UX/immersion layer (no flow/logic changes, no new progress system) that reflows each
mission dashboard into a 3-column "mission-control workstation" DURING an active mission.
Reuses the SAME three existing grid children (M1 `#dashboard`, M2 `#mission2Dashboard`):
`.mission-panel` (LEFT), `.center-column` (CENTER), `.xp-panel` (RIGHT, repurposed). All
element IDs are preserved so every render fn + handler is unchanged. The 25E CSS block is
appended at the END of `style.css` (replaced the 25D block, ~6224+).
- **3-col split gated on `body.mission-running`**: `grid-template-columns:3fr 5fr 2fr` with
  `.mission-panel` `order:1` (LEFT "Mission Control"), `.center-column` `order:2` (CENTER
  terminal), `.xp-panel` `order:3` (RIGHT "Live Status"). The legacy 25A Focus-Mode rule
  `body.focus-mode .xp-panel{display:none}` is OVERRIDDEN during play
  (`body.mission-running.focus-mode .xp-panel{display:flex}`) — without this the right column
  vanishes because `beginMission`/`beginMission2` call `enterFocusMode()`.
- **RIGHT column dual-purpose**: the `.xp-panel` holds BOTH a `.agent-profile` wrapper (shown
  pre-mission) and a `.live-status` block (shown during active), toggled by
  `body.mission-running .xp-panel .agent-profile{display:none}` / `.live-status{display:block}`.
  The panel header has two titles `.xp-title-profile` ("AGENT PROFILE") + `.xp-title-status`
  ("LIVE STATUS"), toggled the same way. `.live-status` (default `display:none`) contains
  `#alertCenter`/`#threatMeter`/`#trustScore`/`#confidenceMeter`/`#investigationBoard`, an
  "Evidence Details" drawer wrapping `#evidencePanel`, the relocated `#m1HintBtn`
  (`.hint-request-btn--block`, M1 only — M2 has no hint button), and an "Available Tools"
  drawer wrapping `#toolsPanel`. M2 mirrors with `m2*` IDs.
- **CENTER column**: `#currentObjective`/`#m2CurrentObjective` (now `.current-objective--center`)
  relocated to the TOP of the commands `.panel-body`, above the command buttons. During play
  the inline `.hint-panel`, `.task-brief`, and `.commands-hint` in the commands panel are
  hidden (the Current Objective supersedes them), keeping the terminal dominant.
- **LEFT column**: the compact `.mini-map` (relabeled "Mission Control") becomes a LARGE
  VERTICAL route during active (`body.mission-running .mission-panel .mini-map` → column;
  nodes are full-width rows with bigger 40px dots, vertical `.mini-path` connectors). The
  active node pulses (`@keyframes miniNodePulse` cyan / `miniNodePulseGreen` for
  active+completed); honored by a `prefers-reduced-motion` override. `#courseProgress` was
  wrapped in a "Course Progress" `.collapsible focus-collapse` drawer; briefing/progress/
  tracker drawers already carry `.focus-collapse`, so Focus Mode auto-collapses all dense
  content during play.
- **Responsive**: desktop 3-col; tablet (≤1100px) the LEFT Mission Control spans full width
  on TOP (`grid-column:1/-1`) with terminal+Live-Status as 2 cols below, and the left map
  reverts to horizontal; mobile (≤700px) single column ordered terminal → mission control →
  live status.
- **JS touch**: only `pushManagerMessage` feed trim changed 5→3 (`script.js` ~6681); no
  render/flow logic changed. Verified e2e on M1 + M2 (3-col layout, big left map, center
  terminal, right Live Status visible under Focus Mode, pin→board/confidence update, Open
  Full Map back-nav).

### Command-on-click typing
When a player CLICKS an M1 command button, the command is first TYPED into the terminal
entry (`#terminalInput`, ~38ms/char) so it's visible before being sent, then executed.
`typeCommandIntoTerminal(command, onDone)` (after `runCommand`, ~`script.js` 4306) drives it,
with `cancelTerminalTyping` (no-op-safe) and `flushTerminalTyping` (a rapid second click flushes
the current command so none is dropped). The M1 click handler types then runs. `cancelTerminalTyping`
is called centrally in `endGuidedRun()` (covers every mission-exit: map/overview/back/reset) and in
`abortDemo` so a deferred `runCommand` can never fire off-screen after the student navigates away.

### Opt-in Guided Demo (Mission 1)
An OPT-IN walkthrough offered on the M1 guided "Mission Ready" screen (a "Watch
Demo First" button `#guidedDemoBtn`, M1 only — M2 unaffected). It launches a clean Mission 1
and TEACHES newbies the whole workstation: it both CLICKS command buttons (`demoClickCommand`
— a real `.click()` + a `.demo-press` flash, so the click-to-type animation plays) AND shows
MANUAL typing (`demoTypeCommand`, e.g. read-only `pwd`), runs REAL example commands (`ls` →
`pwd` → `cd documents`/`ls` → `cat finance_update.txt` → `cat suspicious_file.txt`), classifies
the suspicious file as Critical, and a pop-out (`#demoCoach`, reuses
`.ig-coach`/`.ig-dim`/`.ig-spotlight-target`) MOVES to and DESCRIBES each area (command center →
terminal → Current Objective → Live Status threat meter → Investigation Board → hint button →
decision actions), then fully resets and returns the student to the Mission Ready screen so they
do it themselves. The demo module lives at the bottom of `script.js` (~7390+): `DEMO_STEPS`
(15 steps), `m1KeyForCommand`, `demoClickCommand`, `demoTypeCommand`, `startDemo`,
`demoGo`/`demoNext`/`demoBack`, `renderDemoStep`, `showDemoCoach`, `positionDemoCoach`,
`teardownDemoCoach`, `abortDemo`, `endDemo`, `demoWait`/`clearDemoTimers`.
- **Progression commands use real clicks, not no-key `runCommand`**: `afterCommand(key)`
  early-returns on an empty key, so typed/no-key commands DON'T unlock/advance. The demo runs
  progression steps via `demoClickCommand` (real button click → `runCommand(cmd, key)` →
  `afterCommand` fires); only read-only commands (`pwd`) use `demoTypeCommand`.
- **No floating-control overlap (stuck-step fix)**: `startDemo` adds `body.demo-active` (removed
  in `abortDemo`) which CSS-hides the floating `.focus-control-bar` and `.soundtrack-toggle` —
  they previously overlapped and intercepted the coach's Next button (the demo got stuck at
  "Step 13 of 15"). The demo coach is also raised to `z-index:10000` (above the music toggle's
  9999) as a safety net.
- **Coach stays on-screen**: `positionCoach` (shared by the demo AND the live spotlight tour)
  clamps the tip's `top` within the viewport so its nav buttons never render off-screen when the
  target (e.g. decision actions) is scrolled near the viewport edge.
- **MANUAL step-through (not auto-advancing)**: the pop-out renders three controls —
  `.demo-coach-back` ("← Back", disabled on step 1), `.demo-coach-cancel` ("Cancel"), and
  `.demo-coach-next` ("Next →", or "Finish ✓" on the last step). The student drives the pace.
  `demoNext`/`demoBack` call `demoGo(ix)`, which clamps `ix`, runs each step's real action
  EXACTLY ONCE on forward navigation (tracked by `demoMaxRun`; the `while(demoMaxRun<ix)`
  loop never runs when going Back, so terminal output is never duplicated — cumulative
  terminal output can't be cleanly undone), then renders (deferred by `DEMO_ACTION_DELAY_MS`
  ≈450ms when an action ran so its DOM settles, else immediately). `clearDemoTimers()` in
  `demoGo` dedupes rapid clicks. Cancel → `endDemo`; Finish (`demoNext` on last step) →
  `endDemo`. Both restore the Mission Ready overlay with no soft-lock.
- **Side-effect isolation**: `suppressSave=true` during the demo (reuses the clear-progress
  flag) so nothing persists; `igEnabled=false` so the real spotlight never overlaps.
  `startDemo` snapshots `demoTrustSnapshot = trustScore` BEFORE mutating (because
  `resetMission()` does NOT reset trust — the auto-classify grants +5 trust that would
  otherwise leak into the real run).
- **Single teardown path**: `abortDemo()` (guarded by `if (!demoRunning) return`) is the only
  silent teardown — stops timers, removes the pop-out, `resetMission()`, restores
  `trustScore` from the snapshot, and sets `suppressSave=false` (fail-safe so persistence is
  never left stuck off). It is hooked into the TOP of `endGuidedRun()` (`if (demoRunning)
  abortDemo()`), so EVERY navigation/reset exit that already routes through `endGuidedRun`
  (showMissionsMap, backToModuleOverview, hideMission2Overview, backToMission2Overview,
  resetMission, resetMission2, enterModule resume) aborts the demo cleanly. `endDemo()` =
  `abortDemo()` + re-show the guided Ready overlay (Skip/Finish buttons call it).
- **No recursion**: `abortDemo` sets `demoRunning=false` BEFORE calling `resetMission()`, so
  the nested `resetMission → endGuidedRun → abortDemo` is a no-op. **No self-cancel**:
  `startDemo` calls `endGuidedRun()` (to tear down the briefing overlay) BEFORE setting
  `demoRunning=true`, otherwise the new `endGuidedRun` guard would abort the demo at startup.

### Background Soundtrack
A looping background soundtrack across the whole game (`script.js` ~56-130). The MP3 is
imported via Vite's `@assets` alias (`import soundtrackUrl from "@assets/…mp3"`) — resolves
to a served URL. NOT a seamless loop: when the track ENDS, a `SOUNDTRACK_BREAK_MS` (4s) break
elapses, then it restarts from `currentTime=0`, repeating for the whole session.
- `initSoundtrack()` lazily creates `new Audio(url)` (NOT in the DOM), `loop=false`,
  `volume=0.35`, with an `ended` listener that clears the prior break timer, schedules the
  restart, nulls the timer, and on restart-`play()` rejection drops `soundtrackStarted` so a
  later user gesture can recover playback. `startSoundtrack()` (guarded by `soundtrackStarted`)
  is called from `enterModule()` — the `#enterModuleBtn` click is the user gesture that
  satisfies browser autoplay policy.
- A floating mute toggle (`#soundtrackToggle`, `.soundtrack-toggle`, created in JS) flips
  `audio.muted` and its label "Music: On"/"Music: Off" (+`.is-muted`); unmuting also retries
  start if autoplay was blocked. CSS appended at the END of `style.css`.

### Post-completion UX (terminal pacing + Next Step guidance)
Six UX fixes (no flow/system changes). CSS appended at the END of `style.css`.
- **Paced terminal output**: OUTPUT lines reveal one at a time from ONE shared queue
  (`outputRevealQueue`, `TERMINAL_LINE_DELAY` 550ms) used by BOTH terminals.
  `queueTerminalReveal`/`revealNextTerminalLine` hide lines via `.term-pending` then
  unhide on a timer; `flushTerminalOutput` shows all pending at once;
  `clearTerminalOutputQueue` drops them. `printOutput`/`printBlankLine` queue; `printCommand`
  flushes first (M1 echoes instant). `printM2Line` treats `cmd` AND `prompt` classes as
  instant command echoes (the main M2 flow echoes with `m2-line--prompt`, demo with
  `m2-line--cmd`) and queues output/blank/info. Boot lines stay instant. Clicking either
  terminal (`#terminalOutput`/`#m2Terminal`, wired in `initTerminalInput`) flushes the queue
  (skip-to-end). `clearTerminal` + `resetMission2` clear the queue. `TERMINAL_TYPE_SPEED`=40
  (alias `TERMINAL_TYPE_MS`) is the per-char command typing speed.
- **employee_notes.txt feedback**: `pinReactionText` returns custom lines — correct (Helpful
  Supporting Evidence) → "Good. This note supports proper reporting behavior."; wrong →
  "Re-check this note. It supports reporting suspicious files, but it is not the main threat."
- **Next Step panel**: `buildNextStepHTML(missionId)` (suffix `M1`/`M2`) renders a panel at
  the TOP of each completion screen — "Open Mission Map" (primary, → `showMissionsMap`) +
  "Review Scorecard" (secondary, scrolls to `.scorecard`). Injected into `buildCompletionHTML`
  (M1) and the M2 scorecard; wired via `wireNextStepButtons` in `completeMission` /
  `renderM2Scorecard`.
- **Map button attention (FIX4)**: `setMapButtonsAttention(missionId,on)` toggles
  `.map-cta-attention` (pulse + "Next Step" ::after badge, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored)
  on the map back / "Open Full Map" buttons at completion; `clearAllMapButtonsAttention` clears
  both. Cleared in `showMissionsMap` and `resetMission`/`resetMission2`.
- **Completion clarity (FIX5)**: M2 `syncM2Buttons` disables command buttons when
  `mission2Complete` (re-enabled on restart since `resetMission2` clears the flag + calls
  `beginMission2`). On completion both missions set Current Objective `COMPLETION_OBJECTIVE`
  ("Mission complete. Open the Mission Map to continue.") and manager `COMPLETION_MANAGER`
  ("Good work. Return to the Mission Map to continue your training path.").

### Contextual Event Toast System (Milestone 26A)
A reusable, non-blocking notification layer (no flow/logic/progress changes) that surfaces
short status toasts at key mission events. Does NOT replace manager messages or the Current
Objective. The 26A module lives near the fx helpers in `script.js` (~7184); CSS appended at
the END of `style.css`.
- **API**: `showEventToast(title, message, type)` with `type` ∈ info|success|warning|danger|
  unlock (invalid types fall back to info). Toasts render top-right in `.event-toast-host`
  (fixed, `pointer-events:none` so the terminal is NEVER blocked), slide/fade in, stay
  `EVENT_TOAST_MS` (3500ms), then fade out (`EVENT_TOAST_FADE_MS` 350ms). Each `.event-toast`
  has `.event-toast-dot` + `.event-toast-body`(`.event-toast-title`/`.event-toast-msg`),
  `role=status` + `aria-atomic`, host `aria-live=polite`. Per-type accent colors; responsive
  ≤700px; `prefers-reduced-motion` honored.
- **Max-2 with a real QUEUE (architect fix)**: at most `EVENT_TOAST_MAX` (2) are visible;
  extras are ENQUEUED (`eventToastQueue`) and `renderEventToast` runs when a slot frees
  (each toast's fade-out decrements `eventToastVisible` then `pumpEventToasts()`), so a burst
  never truncates a toast's dwell time. Helpers: `ensureEventToastHost` (idempotent),
  `pumpEventToasts`, `renderEventToast`.
- **Triggers** (each tagged "Milestone 26A"): M1 — `beginMission` (Investigation Started/info),
  `handleM1FileRead` suspicious_file FIRST read only (Suspicious File/warning),
  `handlePinClassification` (Evidence Added/info + Evidence Classified success / Re-check
  Evidence warning — replaced old `fxToast`), `setThreatLevel` rise gated on
  `body.mission-running` (Threat Rising/danger — avoids restore-time spurious fire),
  `handleFindingAnswer` correct (Finding Submitted/success), `completeMission` (New
  Assignment/unlock), `updateManagerReaction` mission_completed (per-mission Mission
  Complete/success — replaced old `fxToast`). M2 — `beginMission2` (Investigation
  Started/info), `runM2Command` ping reachable (Host Reachable/success) + nmap (Services
  Found/info), `handleM2AnalystAnswer` correct (Analysis Correct/success).
- **First-run guards (architect fix)**: repeatable commands fire their toast once.
  `runM2Command` captures `firstPing`/`firstNmap` at the TOP (before the unlock chain mutates
  `m2UnlockedCmds`); `handleM1FileRead` snapshots `firstRead` before `m1FilesReviewed.add`.

### Simulated Adversary Presence (Stage 1)
A Mission-1-only "an attacker is active" immersion layer built ON TOP of the 26A event-toast
system (no backend/AI/multiplayer/real-hacking/redesign). Module lives after `renderEventToast`
in `script.js` (~7254); CSS appended at the END of `style.css`.
- **API**: `triggerAdversaryEvent(eventText, severity, opts)` — `severity` low|medium|high;
  renders a RED-accent toast (`event-toast--adversary` + `event-toast--sev-{low|medium|high}`,
  title "ATTACKER ACTIVITY" for low/medium, "ATTACKER MOVEMENT" for high) AND pulses the active
  mission-route node (`pulseActiveMissionNode` toggles transient `.mini-node--adversary-pulse` on
  `#m1MiniMap/#m2MiniMap .mini-node--active`). `triggerBlueTeamResponse(text)` →
  `event-toast--blueteam` (BLUE, "the good guys"). Both no-op when `demoRunning`.
- **Throttle**: ambient events respect `ADVERSARY_COOLDOWN_MS` (22s, within the 20–40s spec);
  important mission actions pass `{ force: true }` to bypass. `showEventToast` gained an optional
  4th arg `opts.extraClass` (back-compatible; 3-arg callsites unchanged); two new toast types
  added to `EVENT_TOAST_TYPES`.
- **Triggers (M1 only, all gated `def.missionId === "mission-001"` where applicable)**:
  mission start → low ("Suspicious credential request detected.", DELAYED ~2.2s so it reads as
  emergent); first read of `suspicious_file.txt` → medium ("Unknown external email attempting
  credential collection."); poor decision (Ignore Alert) → high ("Potential phishing spread risk
  increasing."); correct escalation (Escalate to Manager) → BLUE TEAM RESPONSE ("Suspicious
  credential activity contained.").
- **Resume/navigation safety (architect fix)**: the delayed mission-start toast is scheduled via
  the tracked `m1AdversaryIntroTimer`. It's CLEARED before re-scheduling in `beginMission` AND in
  `endGuidedRun()` (the central exit hub — covers map/overview/back/reset), and its callback is
  STRONGLY gated (M1 `#dashboard` visible + `body.mission-running` + `missionStarted` +
  `!missionComplete`) so a stale timer can never fire during M2 or after a reset. `freshStart`
  (`!missionLaunched["mission-001"]` captured at the TOP of `beginMission`) ensures it only fires
  on a genuine fresh launch, not a mid-mission resume.

### Blue Team Identity System (Stage 2 — mission-keyed for M1 + M2)
Casts the student as a Blue Team DEFENDER (builds on Stage 1 + the 26A toast system; no
flow/system changes). Originally M1-only, the engine was GENERALIZED to be mission-keyed so
BOTH missions share one engine (no duplicated code). The module lives at the bottom of
`script.js` (~7438+, after `triggerBlueTeamResponse`); panel markup is in `index.html` inside
each mission-panel (M1 `#blueTeamPanel` after the mini-map; M2 `#m2BlueTeamPanel` after the M2
mini-map-panel, before `#m2ManagerPanel`); CSS is SHARED (no `style.css` change for M2).
- **Mission-keyed state + DOM**: state is now objects keyed by mission id
  (`blueTeamContainment`/`blueTeamSteps`/`blueTeamRedActive`/`blueTeamFeeds`, keyed
  `"mission-001"`/`"mission-002"`); `BLUE_TEAM_DOM` maps each mission to its element ids,
  resolved via `btMissionId`/`btDom`. EVERY engine fn takes `missionId` as its FIRST argument
  (`updateContainmentProgress`, `showBlueTeamUpdate`, `setRedTeamActive`, `renderBlueTeamPanel`,
  etc.); `resetBlueTeamM1` was renamed `resetBlueTeam(missionId)`. All M1 callsites pass
  `"mission-001"`; M2 callsites pass `"mission-002"`.
- **M2 containment ladder**: nmap service scan +15 (`m2-recon`, "Exposed services identified.",
  sets Red Team flag), correct Critical pin +25 (`m2-critical`, "Evidence logged."), correct
  escalate decision +30 (`m2-escalate`), correct analyst review +20 (`m2-analyst`) — totals 90,
  then M2 quiz completion forces `set:100` + clears the flag. Poor M2 decision applies the same
  one-time `-10` (`poor-`+actionId). M2 assignment progresses "Map the network" → "Assess
  exposed services" → "Escalate to lead analyst" via `deriveBlueTeamState` (mission-aware; M2
  uses `mission2Complete`).
- **Longer toast dwell**: `showEventToast`/`renderEventToast` gained an optional `opts.duration`
  (fallback `EVENT_TOAST_MS`); adversary toasts use `ADVERSARY_TOAST_MS` (9s), blue-team toasts
  `BLUE_TEAM_TOAST_MS` (7s), so a "Red Team Activity" alert no longer vanishes in ~1–2s.
- **Blue Team Status panel** (`#blueTeamPanel`, M1 left "Mission Control" column): a BLUE TEAM
  badge + "DEFENDING" live dot, an identity card (Team: Blue Team / Role: Cybersecurity Intern /
  Assignment `#blueTeamAssignment` / Incident `#blueTeamIncident`), a hidden-by-default
  "Red Team Activity Detected" flag (`#redTeamFlag`), a Containment Progress bar
  (`#containmentFill`/`#containmentPct`/`#containmentCaption`, 0%→100%), and a short
  "[BLUE TEAM]" update feed (`#blueTeamFeed`, capped at `BLUE_TEAM_FEED_MAX`=4).
- **Reusable engine**: `updateContainmentProgress(amount, opts)` clamped 0–100 (`opts`: `stepId`
  one-time guard, `set` absolute, `caption`, `incident`, `assignment`; flashes the panel + saves);
  `showBlueTeamUpdate(text, opts{toast})` pushes a feed bubble (+ optional blue toast) and persists.
  Helpers: `clampPct`, `renderContainment`, `setContainmentCaption`, `setIncidentStatus`,
  `setBlueTeamAssignment`, `setRedTeamActive` (toggles `#redTeamFlag` + sets "Active Threat"),
  `deriveBlueTeamState` (re-derives incident/assignment from credited steps — restore-safe),
  `renderBlueTeamPanel`, `appendBlueFeedBubble`/`renderBlueFeed`, `resetBlueTeamM1`.
- **Containment ladder (M1, monotonic)**: open `suspicious_file.txt` first-read +15
  (`stepId "open-suspicious"`, "Suspicious file isolated.", incident → Active Threat); correct
  Critical pin +25 (`"classify-critical"`, "Evidence logged."); correct escalate decision +30
  (`"escalate"`, "Incident escalated to lead analyst."); correct finding +20 (`"finding"`,
  "Phishing attempt confirmed and documented."); ladder totals 90, then `completeMission` forces
  `set:100` + incident Contained + `setRedTeamActive(false)`. A poor decision (Ignore) applies a
  one-time `-10` per action (`stepId "poor-"+actionId`) and slows the caption.
- **Adversary linkage**: `triggerAdversaryEvent` passes the long `duration` and calls
  `setRedTeamActive(true)` ("Red Team Activity Detected"); `triggerBlueTeamResponse` routes
  through `showBlueTeamUpdate({toast:true})`.
- **State + persistence**: `m1Containment` (0), `m1ContainmentSteps` (Set of credited step ids),
  `redTeamActive`, and `m1BlueFeed` (bounded feed history) are written in `saveProgress` and
  restored in `restoreSavedProgress` — containment clamped, steps validated via
  `isValidContainmentStep` (known fixed ids OR a `poor-` prefix, hardening against tampered
  localStorage), feed filtered to strings + capped, and forced to 100 when `missionComplete`.
  `renderBlueTeamPanel` re-renders the bar/flag/incident/assignment AND replays the feed history
  (`renderBlueFeed`) so a mid-mission reload resumes containment %, the red flag, AND the feed.
  `resetMission`/`resetMission2` call `resetBlueTeam(missionId)` (zeroes that mission's state +
  clears its feed). Save persists all 4 keyed objects; restore calls `restoreBlueTeamMission` for
  BOTH missions (M1 keeps a legacy fallback to the old flat `m1Containment`/`m1ContainmentSteps`/
  `redTeamActive`/`m1BlueFeed` keys). Verified e2e: full M1 run 0→100 with flag + feed; M2 nmap →
  Critical pin reaching 40% with flag + feed; mid-mission reload resumes containment/flag/feed.

### Adversary Escalation System (Stage 3)
The attacker REACTS to investigation progress. Built ON TOP of the Stage 2 Blue Team engine
(`BLUE_TEAM_DOM`, `btDom`/`btMissionId`, `setRedTeamActive`, `setIncidentStatus`,
`setContainmentCaption`) and the toast system (`showEventToast` with `opts.duration`,
`ADVERSARY_TOAST_MS`). The Stage 3 module sits in `script.js` just after
`restoreBlueTeamMission`. Beginner-friendly by design — escalation is CAPPED.
- **Reusable core**: `triggerEscalationEvent(missionId, opts)` — adversary gains ground:
  rotates an `ESCALATION_EVENTS` red-team message ("[RED TEAM MOVEMENT] Credential harvesting
  attempt spreading.", "[RED TEAM ACTIVITY] Additional employee targeted.", "External
  communication frequency increasing."), raises `incidentPressure[missionId]` by
  `ESCALATION_STEP`, nudges Threat Level up one notch, sets the Red Team flag + a long-dwell
  (`ADVERSARY_TOAST_MS`≈9s) red toast + map pulse, and sets urgency wording ("Escalating" /
  "Pressure rising — act quickly to contain."). `containThreatActivity(missionId)` — correct/
  quick action: relieves pressure by `ESCALATION_RELIEF` and shows "[BLUE TEAM] Threat spread
  interrupted." Both NO-OP during the demo (`demoRunning` guard); `containThreatActivity` only
  speaks when `incidentPressure>0` OR the Red Team flag is set (avoids noise pre-escalation).
- **Caps (beginner-friendly)**: `incidentPressure` is per-mission, clamped to `ESCALATION_MAX`
  (the "Moderate" ceiling — never higher). `escalationLevelLabel` maps the value to
  Stable→Elevated→Moderate. Threat is capped at "High" via `raiseThreatOneStep(missionId, cap)`,
  which is MONOTONIC — if the current threat index is already ≥ the cap (e.g. a poor decision
  already set Critical), it returns WITHOUT lowering the threat (the raise is only ever an
  increase). Idle escalation stops at `ESCALATION_MAX_IDLE_EVENTS` (2) per mission.
- **Delay-based escalation**: an idle watch (`startEscalationWatch`/`scheduleEscalationIdle`/
  `onEscalationIdle`/`clearEscalationWatch`, `ESCALATION_IDLE_MS`≈40s) escalates when the student
  stalls; `noteInvestigationActivity()` (called from `afterCommand`/`runM2Command`) resets the
  clock on real activity. The watch self-stops at the idle/pressure ceiling, on completion, or
  when `body.mission-running` is gone.
- **Wiring**: poor decision (M1+M2) → `triggerEscalationEvent`; correct escalate decision (M1+M2)
  and correct Critical pin (`handlePinClassification`) → `containThreatActivity`;
  `beginMission`/`beginMission2` → `startEscalationWatch`; `completeMission` + M2 quiz completion →
  `clearEscalationWatch` + pressure 0; `resetMission`/`resetMission2` → `resetEscalation`;
  `endGuidedRun` (every mission exit) → `clearEscalationWatch`; `renderBlueTeamPanel` →
  `renderIncidentPressure`. RESUME-SAFE: the watch is torn down on every exit, so it is RE-ARMED
  on same-session re-entry — `openMission1Dashboard` calls `startEscalationWatch("mission-001")`
  in its `missionStarted && !missionComplete` branch, and `beginMission2` calls
  `startEscalationWatch("mission-002")` BEFORE its `m2Started` early-return.
- **UI + persistence**: an "Incident Pressure" block (bar fill + level word) in BOTH Blue Team
  panels (M1 `#incidentPressureWrap`/`#incidentPressureFill`/`#incidentPressureLevel`; M2 `m2*`
  mirror). `incidentPressure` + `escalationIdleCount` are persisted (`saveProgress`) and restored
  clamped (zeroed when the mission is complete). Stage 3 CSS appended at the END of `style.css`
  (amber→red fill, level colors, reduced-motion). Verified e2e on M1: pressure Stable/0 → poor
  decision → Elevated + red toast + threat up → correct escalate → "Threat spread interrupted." +
  pressure drops + flow advances; M1/M2 intact, no console errors.

### Containment Actions (Stage 4 — Mission 1)
A "Blue Team response" layer letting the M1 student pick defensive ACTIONS to neutralize the
threat. Frontend-only, scripted, gated on collected evidence. The module lives in `script.js`
after `resetEscalation` (~8031+). It reuses the Stage 2 containment engine
(`updateContainmentProgress`/`showBlueTeamUpdate`) + threat meter — it does NOT add a new
progress system.
- **Panel**: `#containmentActions` (inside `#blueTeamPanel`, after `#blueTeamFeed`) with status
  `#containmentActionsStatus` + list `#containmentActionsList`. Rendered by
  `renderContainmentActions("mission-001")`. Data-driven via `CONTAINMENT_ACTIONS` +
  `CONTAINMENT_ACTION_ORDER`; buttons carry `data-containment-action`.
- **Four actions**: three CORRECT (`isolate-workstation`, `block-sender`, `escalate-manager`,
  `requiresEvidence:true`) and one POOR (`monitor-activity`, always available). Correct →
  +Trust (`increaseTrustScore`), −Threat one step (`lowerThreatOneStep`, monotonic floor "Low"),
  +Containment (`updateContainmentProgress`, one-time `stepId:action-<id>`), +
  `containThreatActivity` (relieves adversary pressure). Poor → manager guidance only, NO penalty.
- **Evidence gate**: `containmentEvidenceReady() === canCompleteM1()` (suspicious_file.txt pinned
  Critical). Strong actions stay disabled (`.containment-action-btn--locked`, note "Unlocks after
  evidence is collected") until then; enforced in BOTH render and `handleContainmentAction`.
- **Toasts**: every action fires a `showEventToast("BLUE TEAM ACTION", …, "blueteam", {duration:
  BLUE_TEAM_TOAST_MS})`.
- **Post-completion lock** (architect fix): once `missionComplete` (M2: `mission2Complete`), ALL
  four buttons are disabled (note "Threat contained"), status reads "Threat contained — actions
  closed.", and `handleContainmentAction` early-returns — no post-win Trust/Threat/Containment
  mutation. `completeMission` re-renders the panel.
- **Completion screen**: a "THREAT CONTAINED" banner (`.threat-contained-banner`) +
  `buildContainmentSummaryHTML` rows (Threat Spread Prevented [from `escalationPeak`], Evidence
  Collected [`collectedEvidenceCount`], Containment Actions Used, Blue Team Performance). Plus a
  "THREAT CONTAINED" toast.
- **Demo isolation**: `handleContainmentAction` early-returns when `demoRunning`.
- **Persistence**: `escalationPeak` + `containmentActionsUsed` saved/restored (validated against
  `CONTAINMENT_ACTIONS`) and cleared via `resetContainmentActions` in `resetMission`. Boot
  pre-renders the locked panel (after the briefing-room renders, before `restoreSavedProgress`).
- Stage 4 CSS appended at the END of `style.css`. Verified e2e on M1: locked → pin Critical →
  unlock → correct actions raise Containment/lower Threat with BLUE TEAM ACTION toasts → full
  completion shows THREAT CONTAINED banner + 4 summary rows → post-completion panel fully locked
  (all 4 disabled, no mutation on click); M2 intact, no console errors.

### Guided One-Clue-at-a-Time Investigation (Mission 1)
M1 reveals files ONE at a time instead of dumping all `cat-*` cards at once. The "file cards"
ARE the `cat-*` command buttons (the "Inspect Files" group).
- **Gated unlock chain (`missions.js`)**: `cd-documents.unlocksAfterRun = ["ls-documents"]` (no
  file cards yet); `ls-documents.unlocksAfterRun = ["cat-employee-notes"]` (first file only). The
  `~/documents`.ls order was reordered so `security_policy.txt` precedes `suspicious_file.txt`.
- **Reveal order** (`M1_FILE_REVEAL` near the pin state in `script.js`, ~327): employee_notes →
  meeting_schedule → finance_update → security_policy → suspicious_file. Each subsequent file
  card is unlocked by `revealNextM1File(currentFile)` (one-time toast "Next File Available")
  only AFTER the current file is opened AND classified (or skipped).
- **Read → classify directly**: `handleM1FileRead` (M1, rated file) no longer calls `showPinPrompt`
  — it sets `m1ActiveFileKey` via `setM1ActiveFile`, sets the objective "Classify this file…", and
  calls `showClassificationPrompt` directly (no intermediate "Pin to Board" step). If the file is
  ALREADY correctly classified (resume re-read), it instead walks the chain via `revealNextM1File`.
- **Active-file focus**: `showClassificationPrompt` (M1 only) prepends a "🔎 Current File Under
  Investigation" header + a "Skip this file for now" button (`handleM1Skip`, HIDDEN on the last
  file — the suspicious file must be classified to win). `renderButtons` paints file cards:
  `cmd-btn--active-file` (cyan spotlight, the open file), `cmd-btn--reviewed` (dimmed, classified),
  and `cmd-btn--next` glow on the SINGLE earliest unlocked-unclassified file (`m1NextFileBtnKey`,
  computed once per render so exactly one clue glows even after a skip). `body.m1-file-active`
  recedes `.focus-collapse` panels and emphasizes `#pinPanel`.
- **No reclassify warning for M1**: `handlePinClassification`'s host-refresh has an M1 branch that
  clears the panel, `setM1ActiveFile(null)`, and `revealNextM1File(key)` on EITHER correct or
  incorrect — it NEVER re-shows `showPinPrompt`/"Your earlier call didn't fit". The suspicious
  Critical gate (decision/finding flow) is unchanged. `pinReactionText`: employee_notes incorrect →
  "This file supports security awareness, but it is not the primary threat." (correct msg already
  "Good. This note supports proper reporting behavior.").
- **Objectives** (`afterCommand`): cd-documents → "List the contents of the documents folder.";
  ls-documents → "Open the first document to begin your investigation."
- **Demo compatibility**: the opt-in demo walks a curated path (skips ahead to finance/suspicious),
  so `handleM1FileRead`'s per-file classify branch is guarded by `!demoRunning`, and
  `demoClickCommand` reveals the needed `cat-*` button on demand (isolated by `suppressSave` +
  `resetMission` teardown). The demo's explicit `handlePinClassification(suspicious, critical)`
  step still drives completion.
- **Cleanup**: `resetMission` clears `m1ActiveFileKey` + `body.m1-file-active`. CSS appended at the
  END of `style.css`. `m1ActiveFileKey` is session-only (not persisted). M2 untouched. Verified e2e
  (cd→only ls; ls→one file; one-by-one classify advance; employee_notes incorrect msg; no reclassify
  warning; suspicious Critical → decision flow; no console errors).

### Investigative Reasoning Layer (Milestone 27A — Mission 1 ONLY)
Adds an analyst-grade reasoning step between reading a file and classifying it. M2 untouched
(classify buttons branch on `missionId==="mission-002"`). The 27A module sits near the top of
`script.js` (after the pin/XP block, ~485+); data (`M1_REASONING`) + state (`m1AnalystScore`,
`m1ReasoningCorrect` Set, `m1ReasoningBonusAwarded`, `m1AnalysisTimer`) are declared ~232.
- **File contents (`missions.js`)**: the 4 false-lead/supporting files read as mildly odd but
  resolve harmless; `suspicious_file.txt` no longer drops the explicit `[!] WARNING` giveaway —
  students must reason it out.
- **Analyst Confidence** (separate meter from Evidence Confidence, host `#analystConfidence` in
  M1 Live Status): level Low/Building/Strong/Ready painted by `renderAnalystConfidence`
  (pct 18/48/76/100). Score is DERIVED/idempotent via `recomputeM1AnalystScore` (reasoning-set
  size + per-correct-pin points critical 3 / helpful 2 / normal·low 1) — never incremented, so it
  is safe across re-reads and reloads. The recompute is corrupt-state hardened: it only counts
  pin keys present in `EVIDENCE_RATINGS["mission-001"]` with a valid suspicion level.
- **`m1AnalystLevel`**: returns "Ready" once `m1CriticalIdentified()` (= `canCompleteM1()`, i.e.
  suspicious_file correctly Critical), else ≥6 Strong / ≥3 Building / else Low. Ready≡critical is
  INTENTIONAL (anti-soft-lock; matches the spec acceptance "suspicious critical → Ready → finding").
- **Reasoning flow (one prompt at a time)**: `handleM1FileRead` else-branch (guarded by
  `!demoRunning`) → `showM1ReasoningPrompt(key)` renders the per-file MCQ in the pin host (skips
  straight to classification if already in `m1ReasoningCorrect`). `handleM1Reasoning` disables the
  options, shows "Submitting analysis to manager..." for a 700–1200ms `m1AnalysisDelay`, then on
  correct: one-time add to `m1ReasoningCorrect` + recompute + render + manager "why this matters"
  + a "Continue to classification →" button → `showClassificationPrompt`; on wrong: manager
  guidance + retry. M1 classify buttons route through `submitM1Classification` (same delay) →
  `handlePinClassification`; the M1 branch of `handlePinClassification` recomputes the analyst
  score, renders the meter, and calls `maybeAwardReasoningBonus` (+25 XP ONCE when BOTH
  `employee_notes.txt` AND `security_policy.txt` are correctly classified `helpful`).
- **Cancel-safe delay**: both "Submitting analysis..." timeouts are tracked in `m1AnalysisTimer`
  and torn down by `clearM1AnalysisTimer()`, called from `endGuidedRun`, `resetMission`, and
  (via `resetMission`) `abortDemo` — so a stale callback can never mutate pins/XP/UI after the
  student resets, navigates away, or starts the demo.
- **Completion gate**: `showFindingPanel` requires `canCompleteM1() && m1AnalystReadyToSubmit()`
  (Strong or Ready); otherwise it warns via `setHint(...,"warning")` and returns — never soft-locks
  since reading/reasoning more files always raises the score.
- **Persistence**: `saveProgress` persists `m1ReasoningCorrect` (array) + `m1ReasoningBonusAwarded`;
  `restoreSavedProgress` restores them (reasoning keys allowlisted against `M1_REASONING`) and then,
  AFTER pins are restored, calls `recomputeM1AnalystScore()` + `renderAnalystConfidence()`.
  `resetMission` clears the analyst state and repaints the meter; `openMission1Dashboard` repaints
  it on entry. Scorecard: `buildReasoningScorecardHTML` wired into M1 `challengeRows` as an
  "Investigation Reasoning" section.
- **Demo compatibility**: reasoning never fires in the demo (`handleM1FileRead` guarded by
  `!demoRunning`); the demo calls `handlePinClassification` DIRECTLY, bypassing the
  `submitM1Classification` delay; `suppressSave` + `abortDemo→resetMission` (which now clears the
  analyst state and the pending timer) prevent leakage. CSS appended at END of `style.css`
  (analyst meter levels + reasoning prompt + why box + pending pulse + reduced-motion). Verified
  e2e: full M1 reason→classify→meter-climb→suspicious-Critical→Ready→finding; demo to completion;
  reset clears; no console errors.

### Reactive Incident Evolution (Milestone 28B — Mission 1 ONLY)
A thin reactive LAYER (M2 untouched) that makes the M1 incident react believably to the
Blue Team decision: each decision schedules a short sequence of DELAYED "beats" so the
student feels their choice changed what happened next. Reuses existing primitives only
(no backend/AI/branching). Lives in `script.js` right after `buildM1OutcomeVariationHTML`
(~623+).
- **Data-driven `INCIDENT_EVOLUTION`** (keyed by decision id `m1-escalate`/`m1-isolate`/
  `m1-continue`/`m1-ignore`): each beat has optional `delay`, `red:{label,text}`+`pressure`
  (→`triggerEscalationEvent`), `toast:{label,text,type}` (→`showEventToast` flavor, type
  `blueteam`/`adversary`), `contain` (→`showBlueTeamUpdate` feed record, no 2nd toast),
  `manager` (→`pushManagerMessage`), `trust`, `containment` (one-time via stepId
  `evo-<kind>-<i>`), `threatDown` (→ existing `lowerThreatOneStep` + `fxPulseThreat`),
  `timeline` (→`renderIncidentTimelineUpdate`).
- **Engine**: `triggerIncidentEvolution(eventType)` clears any prior run then queues +
  `scheduleNextIncidentBeat()`; ONE cancel-safe timer (`incidentEvolutionTimer`) drives
  `advanceIncidentState()` → `applyIncidentBeat()`. `incidentEvolutionActive()` guard
  (M1 `#dashboard` visible + `mission-running` + `missionStarted` + `!missionComplete` +
  `!demoRunning`) bails+tears down if a beat would fire off-screen. State vars
  `incidentEvolutionTimer/Queue/Kind`. NOTE: do NOT redeclare `lowerThreatOneStep` — it
  already exists (~9105, `(missionId, floor)` monotonic); the engine reuses it.
- **Wiring** in `resolveDecisionAction`: advancing branch adds a decision-specific timeline
  entry (escalate→"Escalation initiated", isolate→"Workstation isolated", continue→
  "Investigation continued quietly") then `triggerIncidentEvolution(actionId)`; the poor
  (`m1-ignore`) branch adds "Threat dismissed — re-evaluating" + `triggerIncidentEvolution
  ("m1-ignore")` (kept LIGHT — the immediate poor-decision penalty already applied, so the
  later beat nudges not punishes). Replaced the old generic "Containment action initiated"
  entry; removed dead `scheduleM1DelayedRedTeam`/`clearM1RedTeamTimer`/`m1RedTeamTimer`.
- **Teardown**: `clearM1DecisionTimers()` now calls `clearIncidentEvolution()`, so EVERY
  mission-exit already routed through `endGuidedRun()` (map/overview/back/reset/demo-abort/
  resume) cancels pending beats. State is ephemeral (NOT persisted).
- **4 reactive outcomes** (`m1OutcomeVariation`, never hard-fails): correct & peak 0 →
  "Excellent Containment"; correct & peak>0 → "Reactive Recovery" / "Threat stabilized
  after operational escalation." (new, cyan `.mission-outcome--reactive`); acceptable →
  "Delayed Containment" / "...limited phishing expansion."; else → "Weak Response".
  `renderIncidentTimelineUpdate` flashes the newest row via `.incident-timeline-row--new`.
  CSS appended at END of `style.css` (~7648+), incl. reduced-motion override. Verified:
  typecheck clean, boots with no console errors; architect review PASS.

### Readable Alerts + Manual Command Sync (9-fix UX pass)
A UX/sync layer (M1 focus; M2 untouched; no flow/system changes).
- **Alerts**: `.event-toast-host` moved top-RIGHT → top-CENTER above the terminal (CSS
  appended at END of `style.css` so it wins; slower in/hold/out fade). Per-type read time
  via `EVENT_TOAST_DURATIONS` (info/success 5s; warning/unlock/danger/adversary/blueteam 7s;
  mission-complete toasts pass explicit `duration:8000`). `ADVERSARY_TOAST_MS` 9000→7000.
  One major alert at a time: `EVENT_TOAST_MAX` 2→1 (queue drains sequentially via
  `pumpEventToasts`).
- **Typed commands drive M1 progression** (parity with button clicks), all in `processCommand`
  (~4152). A click passes its `buttonKey`; a typed command arrives keyless and `afterCommand`
  early-returns. So when `manual = !buttonKey && missionStarted && !demoRunning`,
  `keyFor(k)=buttonKey?buttonKey:(manual?(k||""):"")` resolves the equivalent key and each
  branch calls `afterCommand(keyFor(...))` — unlock/advance/objective/button-state update
  identically. `ls`→ls-home/ls-documents by `currentDir`; `cat`→`m1BtnKeyForFile`;
  `cd`→cd-documents. Demo unaffected (`demoRunning` makes `manual` false → demo's
  `demoTypeCommand` stays keyless); M2 unaffected (`#terminalInput` only feeds M1 — M2 uses
  `runM2Command` + `#m2Terminal`).
- **Normalization** (FIX 6): trailing slash on cd/ls targets, leading `./` on cat, collapsed
  whitespace, lowercased matching; added `ls <folder>` peek.
- **Repeated `cd` is friendly, not an error** (FIX 5): "already inside" compares the target to
  the current folder's LEAF (`currentDir.split('/').pop()`), NOT `${currentDir}/${target}`
  (which yields `~/documents/documents` and falsely fails). Repeated `cd documents` in
  `~/documents` → "Already inside documents folder." + idempotent `afterCommand("cd-documents")`.
  `cd .`/empty target is a NO-OP that never advances progression (only `documents` gates M1).
- **Student-friendly errors** (FIX 8): warn-class guidance ("There's no folder named X here.
  Type ls to see the folders you can open.") instead of harsh bash/cat errors.
- Verified: typecheck clean, clean boot/HMR with no console errors, architect review (it caught
  the two cd-branch bugs above — both fixed).

### Cinematic Incident Interruptions (Milestone 28C)
A thin "emotional emphasis" layer that briefly dramatises MAJOR incident moments and renders
AROUND the existing 26A event-toast system — its position/timing/queue/durations are UNCHANGED.
The 28C JS module sits after `fxPulseXP` (`script.js` ~9368); the CSS is appended at the END of
`style.css`.
- **Public API**: `showIncidentInterruption(eventType, opts)`. Severities: `info | caution |
  threat | containment | mission`. `eventType` resolves through `INCIDENT_INTERRUPTIONS`
  (semantic name → severity + optional short manager follow-up) or accepts a raw severity.
  `opts.force` bypasses the cooldown (mission-complete only); `opts.severity`/`opts.manager`
  override the config.
- **Effects layered AROUND the alert** (never instead of it): a brief background dim/vignette
  (`#incidentCinemaLayer`, `pointer-events:none`, z-index 8000 — BELOW the toast host 9500 so
  alerts stay readable), an active mission-node pulse (`pulseActiveMissionNode`), the
  severity-appropriate meter/panel pulse (`fxPulseThreat` for threat/caution;
  `pulseContainmentPanel` for containment/mission; `fxPulseConfidence` for info), a transmission
  pulse (`pulseTransmissionIndicator` on the manager panel), a terminal flicker
  (`terminal--cinema-flicker` on the active terminal output), and dramatic typing pacing — a
  module-level `terminalPaceMultiplier` (default 1) that `typeCommandIntoTerminal` multiplies
  `TERMINAL_TYPE_MS` by; the cinematic bumps it to 1.8 (2.4 for mission) for ~1.1s then restores.
- **Guards**: bails on `demoRunning` (never intrudes on the teaching demo); only ONE cinematic
  at a time (`incidentCinemaActive`) + a 1200ms cooldown (`INCIDENT_CINEMA_COOLDOWN_MS`). The
  short, operational manager follow-up fires ~1.1s later via `pushManagerMessage` (its built-in
  consecutive-dedupe naturally prevents spam when the same line repeats).
- **Hooks (MAJOR events only — never per command/file/XP/evidence)**: `triggerEscalationEvent`
  → `"escalation"` (threat); `triggerAdversaryEvent` → `"red-team-movement"` (threat);
  `containThreatActivity` → `"containment-success"` (containment); `completeMission` →
  `playMissionCompleteCinema("mission-001")`.
- **Mission-complete transition**: `playMissionCompleteCinema` adds a BRIEF, auto-dismiss
  centered caption ("MISSION COMPLETE / Threat Contained", `#incidentCinemaBanner`,
  `pointer-events:none`, z-index 8500 — NOT a popup/modal, no buttons) + a Mission 2 node unlock
  glow (`glowNextMissionNode` on mini-maps + the full `#missionsMap` node), layered around the
  existing completion alerts/objective (which are unchanged).
- **Teardown (every mission-exit)**: all timers (fade, manager follow-up, glow) are tracked in
  `incidentCinemaTimers` via `cinemaTimer()`; `clearIncidentCinema()` cancels them, restores
  `terminalPaceMultiplier`, clears the dim layer, and removes the banner. It is called from
  `endGuidedRun()` (covers map/overview/back/reset/resume) AND explicitly at the top of
  `showMission2Overview()` — the M1→M2 "Continue" path lands there WITHOUT routing through
  `endGuidedRun`, so a delayed cinematic callback could otherwise fire on M2 (architect-caught).
- **Accessibility**: a `prefers-reduced-motion` block disables the flicker/glow/keyframe
  animations and shortens the fades.
- Verified: typecheck clean, clean boot with no console errors, architect review (it caught the
  `showMission2Overview` teardown gap above — fixed).

### Cyber Operations Center Spatial Layout (Milestone 29A)
ADDITIVE atmosphere/polish on the existing 25E 3-column active-mission layout (LEFT
`.mission-panel` = Mission Operations, CENTER `.center-column` = Active Investigation, RIGHT
`.xp-panel`/`.live-status` = Live Intelligence). NO panel-moving DOM surgery, no new
gameplay/progress state — everything READS from existing state. 29A JS module is appended at
the END of `script.js` (~10374+); 29A CSS block is appended at the END of `style.css` (~7819+).
- **Persistent operations strip** (`.ops-strip`): `buildOpsStrip`/`initOpsStrips` inject one
  strip as the FIRST child of `#dashboard` and `#mission2Dashboard` at boot (idempotent), shown
  only during `body.mission-running` (`grid-column:1/-1`). Four live chips (`data-ops`:
  team/incident/threat/containment) + a rotating ambient line. `updateOpsStrip(missionId)` reads
  `getThreatLevel`, `blueTeamContainment[mid]`, and `btDom(mid,"incident").textContent`; it is
  no-op-safe before the strip exists (restore) and is called from `setThreatLevel`,
  `setIncidentStatus`, `renderContainment`, `setRedTeamActive`, and `completeMission`.
  `updateAllOpsStrips()` fires on `setMissionRunning(true)`.
  - GRID-ROWS PITFALL: the strip needs `body.mission-running .dashboard{grid-template-rows:auto 1fr}`,
    but that 29A rule is LATER in `style.css` than the 25E responsive blocks, so it would clobber
    their stacked `grid-template-rows:auto`. Fixed by re-asserting `auto` in 29A `@media`
    (≤1100px and ≤700px) overrides (architect-caught).
- **Spatial hierarchy (CSS, `body.mission-running` scoped)**: CENTER brighter + subtle cyan glow;
  faint cool wash on LEFT, faint warm wash on RIGHT; reduced panel borders/shadows. No eyebrow
  labels (kept subtle to avoid clutter — T002 satisfied via washes + center focus).
- **Environmental reactions** (transient, self-clearing): `pulseIntelRegion` (RIGHT `.xp-panel`,
  class `region--intel-pulse`) hooked into `triggerEscalationEvent` + `triggerAdversaryEvent`;
  `glowOpsRegion` (LEFT `.mission-panel`, class `region--ops-glow`) in `completeMission`.
  `flashRegion` force-reflows then removes the class after the animation; `clearOpsAtmosphere`
  strips lingering classes on `setMissionRunning(false)`. `pulseIntelRegion` is `demoRunning`-guarded.
- **Ambient ops updates**: one rotating line (`AMBIENT_OPS_LINES`, 22s interval) — NOT a feed.
  `startAmbientOps`/`stopAmbientOps` are cancel-safe and driven by `setMissionRunning` (start on
  true, stop on false), so every mission-exit path tears the timer down. Guarded by `demoRunning`.
- **Mission 3 immersion (still LOCKED)**: `mapStatusLabel` returns "Monitoring" for `comingSoon`;
  `renderMissionMapStates` + `renderMiniMap` toggle `.mission-node--monitoring` /
  `.mini-node--monitoring` (amber recon pulse); details launch button reads "Monitoring · Locked"
  and stays disabled.
- Verified: `node --check` clean; e2e Playwright reached the active M1 dashboard (ops strip
  visible, 3-col layout intact, M3 "Monitoring", no console errors); architect review PASSED
  (only the grid-rows responsive override, now fixed).

### Persistent Adversary Presence (Milestone 30A)
A continuously active, ADAPTING Red Team layer on top of the existing Blue Team / escalation /
containment engines + the 29A ops center. ADDITIVE only — NO backend/AI/new progress system,
beginner-friendly (no punitive mechanics). The 30A module lives at the bottom of `script.js`
(before the final `DOMContentLoaded`).
- **Derived state, no new persistence**: a compact `.red-team-panel` (M1 `#redTeamPanel`, M2
  `#m2RedTeamPanel`) is JS-injected into each `.live-status` block ABOVE the threat meter
  (anchors `#threatMeter` / `#m2ThreatMeter`). Its resting STATE (`computeRedTeamState`) and the
  gradually-revealed "Possible Adversary Goal" chips (`adversaryGoalsRevealed`) are DERIVED from
  EXISTING already-persisted state (`missionComplete`/`mission2Complete`, `blueTeamContainment`,
  `getThreatLevel`, `incidentPressure`, `blueTeamRedActive`, `blueTeamSteps` size) — so reload
  has NO persistence drift and NO new save/restore/reset was added. Only a transient
  `adversaryMovement` flavor line lives in memory.
- **Six states** (`RED_TEAM_STATES`, tone watch/warn/danger/calm): recon → harvest → outbound →
  expanding → pressure → stabilized. **Four goals** (`ADVERSARY_GOALS`) reveal one per credited
  containment step (full on completion). **Movement lines** (`RED_TEAM_MOVEMENT_LINES`) rotate on
  a cancel-safe ~30s beat (`startRedTeamMovement`/`stopRedTeamMovement`/`scheduleRedTeamMovement`,
  `RED_TEAM_MOVE_INTERVAL_MS`) started/stopped by `setMissionRunning(on/off)`.
- **Adaptation** (`adaptRedTeam`): `triggerEscalationEvent` → "escalate" (shifts to alternate
  account + `flashAdversaryMapReaction` pulses neighbor mini/full map nodes via
  `.node--adversary-react`); `containThreatActivity` → "contained" (calm pulse). `resetBlueTeam`
  → `resetAdversaryPresence` clears only the transient line.
- **Sync + safety**: `updateOpsStrip` calls `updateRedTeamActivity(mid)` (try/catch) so the panel
  tracks the same state as the 29A strip. Every helper no-ops before the panel exists
  (boot/restore) and ALL runtime behaviors guard on `demoRunning` (teaching-demo isolation).
  `initRedTeamPanels()` runs in `boot()` right after `initOpsStrips()`. `AMBIENT_OPS_LINES` gained
  4 environmental lines (email filtering, monitoring elevated, SOC reviewing, finance notified).
- Verified: `node --check` clean; e2e reached active M1 with "Red Team Activity" + "Possible
  Adversary Goal" visible above the threat meter, no console errors; architect review PASSED.

### Mission 2 Pattern Parity (Milestone 31A)
Applies Mission 1's per-step "reason → pin" gameplay/UX to Mission 2 (Network Exposure) for
consistency while preserving M2's network identity. ADDITIVE only — no backend, no Mission 3,
no removal of M2 content. M1 untouched.
- **Per-step sequencing (one thing at a time)**: `runM2Command` shows command output + unlocks
  the next command, then defers to `renderM2Reasoning(key)` instead of immediately offering the
  pin. `M2_REASONING` (keyed `ip-addr`/`ping-bad`/`ping`/`nmap`) holds a 3-option MC question +
  `correctMsg` + analyst-confidence delta. `handleM2Reasoning(key, letter)`: wrong → gentle
  retry (no penalty, re-enables untried options after a beat); correct → mark answered
  (`m2ReasoningAnswered` Set, one-time credit), bump Analyst Confidence, manager confirm,
  persist, THEN `showPinPrompt("mission-002", key)` + set next objective. The 5th reasoning
  ("what should Blue Team do") is MERGED into the Blue Team decision moment (the decision IS
  that reasoning), so `review` has no reasoning prompt and keeps the decision trigger.
- **Analyst Confidence (separate track from Evidence Confidence)**: `m2AnalystConfidence` (0)
  with `M2_ANALYST_CONF_TIERS` (Low/Building/Developing/Strong/Ready). `renderM2AnalystConfidence`
  draws the `#m2AnalystConfidence` bar (in M2 live-status). Climbs via reasoning deltas
  (`addM2AnalystConfidence`); a correct analyst review forces `setM2AnalystConfidence(100)`
  ("Ready"). Re-rendered on restore + `beginMission2` entry.
- **Blue Team decision = 4 options** (M2 DECISION_ACTIONS): A recommend service restriction
  (correct, completes well), B ignore (poor, no-advance, re-decide), C shut down all (acceptable,
  completes weakly, not rewarded), D continue unrelated (poor scope-drift, no-advance). Poor
  attempts increment `m2DecisionDrift`. M2 framing = "BLUE TEAM RESPONSE REQUIRED" + A/B/C/D.
- **Red Team M2 sets**: `RED_TEAM_STATES_M2` / `ADVERSARY_GOALS_M2` (cap 3) /
  `RED_TEAM_MOVEMENT_LINES_M2` selected via `redTeamStatesFor`/`adversaryGoalsFor`/
  `redTeamMovementFor("mission-002")`; `renderAdversaryStatus`/`adversaryGoalsRevealed`/
  `triggerRedTeamMovement` pick per mission. Network-themed states/goals on the M2 panel.
- **Cinematic beats**: `showIncidentInterruption` fires on reachable host, open services, poor
  decision, correct recommendation, and mission complete (`{force:true}`).
- **Outcome + scorecard**: `m2OutcomeTier()` → Excellent/Delayed/Weak (never fail), shown as a
  subtitle badge + "Operational Outcome" row. `renderM2NetworkScorecardRows()` adds Analyst
  Confidence (Final), Critical Network Evidence (count uses `pin.critical === true` — pins store
  `level`/`critical`, NOT `suspicion`), Red Team State, Blue Team Recommendation, Trust Change,
  Containment Progress. These rows live INSIDE the collapsed "MISSION SCORECARD" section (same as
  Trust Score / Result) — expand it to see them (an e2e text search misses them while collapsed).
- **Persistence + cancel-safety**: `m2AnalystConfidence`/`m2ReasoningAnswered`/`m2DecisionDrift`
  saved (~3271), restored with clamp + allowlist (~3570), cleared in `resetMission2`. Pending
  reasoning timers (pin-offer 700ms / retry 600ms) are tracked in `m2ReasoningTimers` and
  cancelled by `clearM2ReasoningTimers()` in `resetMission2` and `endGuidedRun` so a stale
  callback can't open a pin prompt off-screen after navigation/reset.
- **DELIBERATE DEVIATION (documented)**: reasoning gates the PIN offer, not command-button
  unlocking. M2 keeps its pre-existing progressive command unlock (each command unlocks the
  next on run) — tightening that to a hard reasoning-unlock gate is out of 31A scope and risks
  soft-locks. Acceptance ("pin offered only after correct answer") is met.
- Verified: `node --check` clean; workflow restarts clean; full M2 e2e (map → launch → commands
  → reasoning → pins → decision → analyst review → quiz → scorecard) succeeded.

### Cyber Operations Career Entry Experience (Milestone 32A)
Reframes the entry screen (`#moduleLanding`) from a course dashboard into a "CyberCorp
Operations Center" home where the player reports for duty on Blue Team. PRESENTATION-ONLY —
no flow/logic/state changes, no backend/AI/auth, no Mission 3 (its assignment is a
non-launchable placeholder). Existing systems untouched: M1/M2, mission map, terminal,
save/restore/clear, name gating.
- **Markup** (`index.html`, inside `.module-landing-card`): header (title "CyberCorp
  Operations Center" / subtitle "Blue Team Network Defense Division"), a 4-chip
  `.ops-status-strip` (Blue Team: Active / Security Posture: Elevated / Threat Monitoring:
  Online / Current Role: Cybersecurity Intern), a 2-col `.ops-grid` (LEFT = Career Track
  + Active Assignments; RIGHT = Sarah Reyes manager + Live Threat Status), and an
  `.ops-signin` row. PRESERVED IDs `#studentNameInput`, `#enterModuleBtn` (relabeled
  "Start Blue Team Shift"), `#saveIndicatorLanding`, `#clearProgressBtnLanding` keep
  `syncEnterBtn` gating + save/clear wiring intact.
- **`renderOperationsCenter()`** (`script.js`, before `enterModule`, ~5922) + helper
  `setOpsAssignment()`: pure presentation, reads existing state ONLY (`missionComplete`,
  `mission2Complete`, `currentXP`/`MAX_XP`, `trustScore`), every DOM lookup guarded.
  Computes promotion% = `(missionsDone/2)*70 + (currentXP/MAX_XP)*30` clamped 0–100 (note
  `INITIAL_XP=750` baseline → a fresh recruit reads ~23%). Maps Active Assignments to
  missions: A1=mission-001 (Available→Completed), A2=mission-002 (Locked until M1 done →
  Available→Completed), A3=Monitoring placeholder; sets row state classes
  `ops-assign--available|completed|locked|monitoring`. Adapts Sarah Reyes' message, the
  containment line (`Stable` once any mission done, else `In Progress`), and XP/Trust chips.
- **Refresh triggers**: called at end of `boot()`, `restoreSavedProgress()`,
  `clearSavedProgress()`, AND on every in-session return to the landing
  (`backToModuleOverview()`, `hideMission2Overview()`) so the home never shows stale
  career/assignment/XP state (architect fix).
- **Launch sequence**: `SIM_BOOT_LINES` (~3954) replaced with 5 operational lines
  ("Initializing Blue Team workspace..." → "Operations Center ready."). Flow itself
  (`enterModule` → `runSimulationLoader` → `showMissionsMap`) is UNCHANGED.
- **Map relabel** (`index.html` ~279/281): full map title "Cyber Missions Map" → "Cyber
  Operations Map", eyebrow value "Mission Control" → "Operations Command". Nodes/launch
  behavior unchanged (the in-mission mini-map "Mission Control" labels are left as-is).
- **CSS** appended at END of `style.css` (`.ops-*`), reusing dark/cyber tokens; `#moduleLanding
  .module-landing-card` widened to 1040px (takeover-preview reuse unaffected); responsive
  stack ≤900px.
- Verified: `node --check` clean; workflow restarts clean; e2e (fresh sign-in gating →
  Start Shift → launch sequence → Operations Map → launch M1) + in-session return refresh
  regression both passed; browser console clean.

### Persistent Player Identity & Career Reputation (Milestone 33A)
A lightweight, PROFESSIONAL analyst-reputation layer on the Operations Center home + scorecards
(no RPG/fantasy, no raw-stat dashboards, no backend/AI). Reputation is DERIVED at render from
already-persisted signals; the ONLY new persisted state is `operationalHistory`. No new progress
system — it reuses `missionComplete`/`mission2Complete`, `trustScore`, `currentXP`, mission
outcomes, evidence pins, etc.
- **State**: `operationalHistory = []` (~256) + `OPERATIONAL_HISTORY_MAX = 12`.
- **Reputation engine** (`script.js`, after `renderOperationsCenter`, ~6004): `countCriticalPins`,
  `calculateAnalystBehavior` (normalizes existing signals: `trustScore`, `blueTeamContainment`,
  `escalationPeak`/`ESCALATION_MAX`, `m1ReasoningCorrect`, `m2AnalystConfidence`,
  `m1FalseLeadsChecked`, `investigationPins`, `m1OutcomeVariation`, `m2OutcomeTier`,
  `m2DecisionDrift`, `decisionTaken`), `repTier`, `analystProfileRatings`,
  `analystReputationStanding`, `analystReputationTraits`, `managerTrustEvolutionMessage`,
  `updateOperationalReputation`, `renderAnalystProfile`, `buildOperationalAssessmentHTML`. All
  derive-at-render and DOM-guarded — nothing throws on a fresh/empty state.
- **Markup** (`index.html`): a `.ops-profile-grid` section after `.ops-grid` (~233) — LEFT
  "Analyst Profile" (reputation standing + traits + 3 ratings: containment/threat-response/
  manager-trust), RIGHT "Previous Operations" list. Plus a hidden `#opsReadinessRow` recognition
  line. IDs: `opsProfileName`, `opsRepStanding`, `opsRepTraits`, `opsRatingContainment/Threat/Trust`,
  `opsHistoryList`, `opsAnalystXp`.
- **`renderAnalystProfile()`** fills those IDs (all guarded) and is called at the END of
  `renderOperationsCenter()`, so EVERY home-reveal path (boot/restore/clear/back-nav) refreshes the
  profile (per memory `ech-landing-render.md`). `renderOperationsCenter` also extends Sarah Reyes'
  message with world recognition + a manager trust-evolution line and toggles `#opsReadinessRow`.
- **Completion hooks** — one call to `updateOperationalReputation(missionId)` from: M1
  `completeMission`, M2 quiz path `handleM2QuizAnswer`, AND M2 engine path `completeMissionEngine`.
- **`operationalHistory` entries** use stable ids (`op-m1`, `op-m1-outcome`, `op-m2`,
  `op-m2-outcome`) and are UPSERTED (one canonical record per id; a replay refreshes status/label
  to the latest outcome instead of duplicating), capped at `OPERATIONAL_HISTORY_MAX`.
- **Scorecards**: `buildOperationalAssessmentHTML(missionId)` injected after the outcome summary in
  M1 `buildCompletionHTML` and M2 `renderM2Scorecard` (2–3 professional bullets from that mission's
  behavior).
- **Persistence**: `operationalHistory` saved in `saveProgress`, restored (validated shape + deduped
  + capped) in `restoreSavedProgress`, reset to `[]` in `clearSavedProgress`. NOTE: it is career
  memory, so it is NOT cleared by `resetMission`/`resetMission2` — only by full clear-progress.
- **CSS** appended at END of `style.css` (`.ops-profile-grid`, `.ops-profile`, `.ops-rep-*`,
  `.ops-rating-list`, `.ops-history-*`, `.op-assessment-*`), reusing dark/cyber tokens; responsive
  ≤900px.
- Verified: `node --check` clean; workflow restarts clean; fresh render shows "Awaiting First
  Assignment" + empty ops + hidden readiness with NO console errors; restore plumbing confirmed in
  the app's own frame (studentName restores, profile renders error-free). NOTE: the e2e harness
  CANNOT prime localStorage for restore tests — `page.evaluate` writes to the proxy-shell frame, but
  the app reads its OWN nested-iframe localStorage; drive persistence THROUGH the app UI instead.

### Intern Career Vertical Slice (Phase 2)
Additive/presentation-only polish so the two-assignment Intern track reads as ONE coherent
career inside a living SOC. NO new missions/architecture; all internal IDs preserved
(`mission-001/002/003`, element IDs, fn/var names, CSS classes).
- **Terminology**: career-facing copy says "Assignment"/"Operation" instead of "Mission".
  Covered surfaces: nav ("ASSIGNMENTS"), focus bar, Operations Map node labels/aria-labels +
  details header + launch button, M2 overview, completion headings/subtitles, certificates
  ("Assignment 1/2 …", "all assignments"), toasts ("Assignment Complete", "New Assignment"),
  terminal lines, scorecard "NEXT ASSIGNMENT PREVIEW", M2 manager/hint dialogue, next-step copy,
  cinema banner ("ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE"). A2 DISPLAY name "Network Basics" → "Network Exposure
  Review" (the `M2_SCORECARD.missionName`, certificate, module title, eyebrow, unlock lines).
  Internal labels NOT changed: progress-tracker step labels ("Mission 2 Started/Complete"),
  engine self-test registry checks, deep "Begin/Restart Mission" CTA, and the footer "Run Mission
  Engine Check" dev button (internal system names, intentionally left).
- **Continuity** (`MANAGER_MESSAGES.missionComplete`, `MANAGER_REACTIONS`): M1 completion
  forward-refs A2; M2 `mission_started` references the contained phishing incident + elevated
  monitoring; M2 `mission_completed` references BOTH assignments + recon prep. `MISSION_MAP`
  transmissions/briefings carry the same thread (done earlier in Phase 2).
- **Living SOC board** (`renderOperationsCenter`, threat rows now ID'd `#opsThreatPhishing/
  Probing/Recon/RedTeam` + `#opsRedTeamStatus`): rows react to progress — phishing detected→
  contained (m1Done), probing monitored→reviewed (m2Done), recon observation→"pressure
  increasing" (m2Done), Red Team Monitored→Active→Escalating(Recon) by `missionsDone`
  (Blue/Red rhythm). End-of-track manager line points toward Junior SOC Analyst readiness +
  Reconnaissance Detection prep. All derived-at-render from existing flags; NO new persisted state.
  Rows rebuilt via `escapeHtml` before `innerHTML`.
- **Progression**: `#opsPromoText` flips to "ready for Junior SOC Analyst review" once `m2Done`.
  New `analystCareerReadiness()` (derived from `missionComplete`/`mission2Complete` only) drives
  `#opsRepReadiness` in the Analyst Profile (Onboarding → Building → Promotion-Ready).
- **A3 anticipation**: reuses the existing Milestone 29A `.mission-node--monitoring` /
  `.mini-node--monitoring` pulse (NO new pulse CSS added); copy + ops board build the anticipation.
- CSS: `.ops-rep-readiness` appended at END of `style.css`. Verified `node --check` clean,
  workflow restarts clean, fresh home renders the assignment terminology + living board with no
  console errors.
